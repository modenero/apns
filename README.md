# APNS: Avalanche Push Notification Service

https://apns.io

### An "official" entry into the [Moralis + Avalanche hackathon](https://moralis.io/avalanche-hackathon/) by the team from Modenero for Best Opt-In Notification System Implementation for dApps.

> Snowball is looking for an implementation of a working notification system prototype, which users can opt-in to with a public address and signature. What’s more, Snowball hopes for a solution that ties this together with users’ Discord, Twitter, email, or phone number for notifications.
