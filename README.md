> As the submission deadline for the Moralis + Avalanche hackathon has long passed, I'm not expecting this to qualify for any prizes. However, it is my intention to __build strong & long lasting relationships with the organizers, sponsors, investors and especially the DeFi platforms of this EPIC event.__ I would greatly appreciate consideration from the team @ Snowball for ANY possible future collaborations, based on the work that will be performed in this repository over the next few days and weeks. ðŸ’ª  
Cheers!

# APNS: Avalanche Push Notification Service

https://apns.io

### An "official" entry into the [Moralis + Avalanche hackathon](https://moralis.io/avalanche-hackathon/) by the team from Modenero for Best Opt-In Notification System Implementation for dApps.

> Snowball is looking for an implementation of a working notification system prototype, which users can opt-in to with a public address and signature. Whatâ€™s more, Snowball hopes for a solution that ties this together with usersâ€™ Discord, Twitter, email, or phone number for notifications.
