## UNSTOPPABLE

APNS **DOES NOT** depend on a centralized API server, which makes us an **UNSTOPPABLE Service Provider (USP).**
All of your requests are sent using **[Event Logs]()**, which are recorded on-chain.
Our distributed network of blockchain servers read those logs and fulfill your requests.
