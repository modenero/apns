# Introduction

Ava welcome's sponsors to support our platform.


## PPM Premium Advertising

Efficient use of your marketing budget. The TOP sponsors will win the daily PPM Premium Ad slot.

### How many sponsors?

The number of "published" spondors in a day will range from 3 to 10, based on the 7-day average impressions. TBD.

> What is PPM? PPM pay for every 1,000 impressions of the ad, regardless of whether they clicked or not. This is similar to more traditional ads, such as print ads and billboards, and is geared towards visibility and brand awareness. Even if the ad is not clicked on, it is still displayed.

1. Avalanche (AVAX)
