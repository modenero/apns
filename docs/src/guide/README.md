# Introduction

The introduction of **Ava's Push Notification Service (APNS)** offers DeFi users the opportunity to add custom alerts for ANY of their favorite platforms or individual smart contracts.

##### IMPORTANT NOTE:  
APNS **DOES NOT** depend on a centralized API server, which makes us an **UNSTOPPABLE Service Provider (USP).**
All of your requests are sent using **[Event Logs]()**, which are recorded on-chain.
Our distributed network of blockchain servers read those logs and fulfill your requests.
